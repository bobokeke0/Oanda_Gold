## 🏆 The Core Strategy - "Triple Confirmation Trend Follower"

This strategy has been profitable in gold markets for years because it waits for **three confirmations** before entering a trade. Gold is a trending market - we ride those trends.

### Strategy Components:

#### 1. **Trend Filter** (20 & 50 EMA)
```javascript
// Use the 20 and 50 period Exponential Moving Averages on 4-hour chart
// BULLISH: Price above 20 EMA, and 20 EMA above 50 EMA
// BEARISH: Price below 20 EMA, and 20 EMA below 50 EMA
// NEUTRAL: Don't trade when EMAs are tangled
```

**Why it works**: Gold trends strongly. Following the trend is 80% of the game.

#### 2. **Momentum Confirmation** (RSI 14)
```javascript
// RSI on 14 periods
// BULLISH: RSI between 40-70 (uptrend momentum)
// BEARISH: RSI between 30-60 (downtrend momentum)
// AVOID: RSI > 75 (overbought) or RSI < 25 (oversold)
```

**Why it works**: Filters out exhausted moves. We want momentum, not extremes.

#### 3. **Entry Trigger** (Support/Resistance + Candlestick Pattern)
```javascript
// Wait for price to pull back to support (in uptrend) or resistance (in downtrend)
// THEN wait for bullish/bearish engulfing candle or hammer/shooting star
// This is our entry signal
```

**Why it works**: Getting a good entry price is the difference between profit and loss.

### Trade Rules:

**LONG Entry (Buying Gold)**:
1. 20 EMA > 50 EMA (trend is up)
2. Price is above 20 EMA
3. RSI between 40-70
4. Price pulls back to support level or 20 EMA
5. Bullish engulfing candle or hammer forms
6. Enter on close of confirmation candle

**SHORT Entry (Selling Gold)**:
1. 20 EMA < 50 EMA (trend is down)
2. Price is below 20 EMA
3. RSI between 30-60
4. Price bounces to resistance level or 20 EMA
5. Bearish engulfing candle or shooting star forms
6. Enter on close of confirmation candle

**Stop Loss**:
- LONG: Below the recent swing low (typically 20-40 pips below entry)
- SHORT: Above the recent swing high (typically 20-40 pips above entry)

**Take Profit**:
- Target 1: 1.5x risk (60% of position)
- Target 2: 2.5x risk (40% of position)
- Move stop to breakeven after Target 1 hit

**Risk Per Trade**: 1-2% of account maximum

## 📰 Fundamental Analysis & Sentiment

Gold trades heavily on **macroeconomic factors**. Your bot needs to be aware of these.

- **Central Bank Gold Buying**: Especially China, Russia, India

#### **BEARISH for Gold** (Go Short XAU/USD):

## ⚖️ Risk Management - The Real Secret to Longevity

**Listen up**: This is why I'm still in business after 20+ years. Not because I'm always right - because I manage risk like my life depends on it.

### Core Risk Management Rules:

#### 1. **Position Sizing Calculator**
```javascript
// Never risk more than 1-2% of account per trade
// Position size = (Account Size × Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss)

// Example:
// Account: $10,000
// Risk per trade: 1.5% = $150
// Entry: $2050
// Stop Loss: $2030
// Distance: $20
// Position Size: $150 / $20 = 7.5 units = 7,500 units (in Oanda terms)
```

### Prompt Template for Position Sizing:
```
"Calculate my position size for this gold trade:

Account Size: $10,000
Risk Per Trade: 1.5%
Entry Price: $2050
Stop Loss: $2030
Currency: USD

Provide:
1. Risk amount in dollars
2. Distance to stop loss in pips/points
3. Correct position size
4. Position size in Oanda units (1 unit = $1 of gold)
5. Risk/Reward ratio if Take Profit is at $2088"
```

#### 2. **Trade Management Decision Support**
```
"I'm in a long gold position with the following details:

Entry: $2050
Stop Loss: $2030
Current Price: $2045
Time in trade: 6 hours
Account: $10,000
Position Size: 7500 units

The price has moved against me slightly. Help me decide:
1. Is this normal market noise or a structural break?
2. Should I:
   a) Hold and trust my stop loss
   b) Exit now to minimize loss
   c) Tighten my stop loss
3. What does the current chart structure look like?
4. Are there any fundamental news that justify this move?
5. Emotional check: Am I feeling FUD? Help me be objective."
```

#### 3. **Drawdown & Portfolio Health Check**
```
"Analyze my trading performance for the last 30 days:

Total Trades: 25
Winning Trades: 16 (64% win rate)
Losing Trades: 9 (36%)
Largest Win: $450
Largest Loss: $180
Average Win: $280
Average Loss: $140
Current Drawdown: -$320 (3.2% of account)

Questions:
1. Is this a healthy trading profile?
2. Is my risk/reward ratio good enough?
3. Should I be concerned about the current drawdown?
4. Should I reduce position sizes temporarily?
5. What's my profit factor? (Total Wins / Total Losses)
6. Am I over-trading?"
```

#### 4. **Scenario Analysis & Stress Testing**
```
"Scenario: Geopolitical crisis erupts - Russia/Ukraine escalation

Current portfolio:
- 2 long gold positions (from $2045 and $2060)
- Total exposure: 15,000 units
- Account size: $10,000

Questions:
1. How might this scenario affect gold prices?
2. Should I:
   a) Add to positions (crisis = gold rally)?
   b) Take partial profits now?
   c) Tighten stops?
   d) Do nothing?
3. What's my maximum risk if both positions hit stop?
4. Should I hedge with any correlating instruments?
5. What's my game plan for different outcomes?"
```

## ⚠️ Trading Psychology & Common Mistakes

### What Keeps Traders Profitable:

1. **Follow Your Rules**: The strategy works. You breaking rules doesn't.
2. **Accept Losses**: 40% loss rate is NORMAL and ACCEPTABLE with proper R:R
3. **Don't Revenge Trade**: Lost $200? Don't try to make it back in one trade.
4. **Trust Your Stops**: They're there for a reason. Don't move them.
5. **Scale In Slowly**: Start with 0.5% risk while learning. Increase as confidence grows.

### Red Flags to Watch For:

```
"Review my last 10 trades and check for these red flags:
1. Am I moving stop losses away from price (bad)?
2. Am I exiting winners too early out of fear?
3. Am I holding losers too long hoping they turn?
4. Am I over-trading (>5 trades per day)?
5. Am I trading outside my defined strategy rules?
6. Give me a psychological health score (1-10) and advice"
```

```

## 🎯 Success Metrics (What "Good" Looks Like)

After 6 months of live trading, here's what success looks like:

- **Win Rate**: 55-65% (we're not trying to be right all the time)
- **Profit Factor**: >1.5 (making $1.50+ for every $1 lost)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: <15% (if you hit 20%, stop and review)
- **Average R:R**: >1.5:1 (winners bigger than losers)
- **Monthly Return**: 3-8% (steady beats spectacular)
- **Trades Per Week**: 2-5 (quality over quantity)

**Remember**: Professional traders aim for consistent, moderate returns. Anyone promising 50%+ monthly is lying or gambling.

const PRACTICE_ACCOUNT = {
  hostname: 'api-fxpractice.oanda.com',
  token: process.env.OANDA_PRACTICE_TOKEN,
  accountID: process.env.OANDA_PRACTICE_ACCOUNT_ID
};

// When ready for live (after 3+ months of profitable paper trading)
const LIVE_ACCOUNT = {
  hostname: 'api-fxtrade.oanda.com',
  token: process.env.OANDA_LIVE_TOKEN,
  accountID: process.env.OANDA_LIVE_ACCOUNT_ID
};
```

### XAU/USD Specifics:

- **Leverage**: Up to 50:1 (but we use max 10:1 for safety)
- **Trading Hours**: 24/5 (closed weekends like forex)

### Price Precision:
```javascript
// Gold prices use 2 decimal places
// Example: 2050.50 (not 2050.5034)
// Always round prices: parseFloat(price.toFixed(2))
```

## 📞 When to Ask Claude for Help

### Good Uses of AI:
- Analyzing current chart setups
- Calculating position sizes
- Identifying patterns you might miss
- Sentiment analysis from news
- Performance reviews and optimization
- Emotional decision support ("Am I being rational?")

### Bad Uses of AI:
- "Should I trade right now?" → Use your strategy rules
- "Give me a hot tip" → No shortcuts
- "I lost 5 trades, what should I do?" → Stick to risk management
- "Predict where gold goes next" → Nobody knows

---

## ⚡ Final Words of Wisdom

**This isn't get-rich-quick. This is get-rich-slow-and-actually-keep-it.**

The strategy works because it's boring, consistent, and respects risk. Most traders fail because they:
1. Over-leverage (risking 10%+ per trade)
2. Don't follow their rules (discretionary nonsense)
3. Don't manage emotions (revenge trading, FOMO)
4. Give up after a few losses (it's a marathon, not a sprint)

You've got the edge with automation and Claude's analytical capabilities. Use it wisely.

**Start small. Trade the strategy. Review performance. Adjust. Repeat.**

That's how you stay in business for 20+ years.
